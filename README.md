# hydra-pcdm
Hydra implementation of the PCDM model

## Access Controls
We are using [Web ACL](http://www.w3.org/wiki/WebAccessControl) as implemented by [hydra-access](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/tree/master/hydra-access-controls) controls

## Example Model
To test the model and provide clarity we have included a sample mode that exercises the interfaces provided by the gem.
The sample model may change over time to reflect the state of the gam and what it supports.  
(TODO: Currently there is no code in the gem so it does not support any model including the example.)
